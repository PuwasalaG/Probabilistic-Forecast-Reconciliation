P = (S'WS)^(-1)S'W

In this simulation we are estimating the P matrix in three ways
1. Estimate W
2. Estimate through the reparameterisation using cholesky decomposition
3. Estimating P directly, imposing the constraint PS=I

Data were first generated using a non-Gaussian data generating process
Here OLS-P is used as the initial parameter in the optimisation. 
Forecasts are calculated only for h=1 to h=3
