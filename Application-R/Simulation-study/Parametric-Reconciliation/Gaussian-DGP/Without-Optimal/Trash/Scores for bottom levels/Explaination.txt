In this simulation, the variance covariance matrix of the reconcilied forecast 
distribution is calculated as, 

sigma = SPWP'S' = S(S'W^-S)^-S'

Different estimates for W were calculated and the forecast accuracy was evaluated

Joint distributions were evaluated with respect to only the bottom level series
