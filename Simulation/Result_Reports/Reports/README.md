# Result Reports

This folder includes pdf files that summarise simulation results.  There are 4 DGPs (Gaussian/Non-Gaussian, Stationary/non-Stationary ARIMA models). Each DGP is forecast using either ARIMA or ETS models (leading to 8 reports). Multivariate base forecasts are formed assuming using all combinations of dependent/independent and Gaussian/bootstrapped residuals. The first table (and first four figures) of results are an evaluation using energy score, the second table (and last four figures) are an evaluation using variogram score.  Multiple reconciliation techniques are used and described in each report.
