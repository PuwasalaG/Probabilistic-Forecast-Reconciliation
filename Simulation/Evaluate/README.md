# Evaluation

This folder includes various scripts for evaluating forecasts.

- The script *evaluate.R* does the main work by finding the energy score for a number of methods.
- The script *tables.Rmd* produces a pdf document with tables of mean energy score and plots based on the Nemenyi post-hoc testing procedure.
- The script *plot_convergence* shows the evolution of the objective function in the score optimisation.  For each scenario one window is randomly chosen.
