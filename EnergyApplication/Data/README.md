# Data Cleaning

- The file *daily.csv* contains data on electricity generation by source in the Australian National Electricty Market (NEM). Data are at a daily resolution from June 11, 2019 to June 10, 2020.

- The file *munge.R* constructs the hierarchy by aggregating series and converts to a tsibble object.

- The file *nem_generation_by_source.rds* is the tsibble object created.
