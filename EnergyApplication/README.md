# Energy Application

- The directory *Data* contains the raw data and scripts for munging the data including constructing the hierarchy.
- The directory *Base_Forecasts* includes a script for producing base forecasts (this is run in parallel and takes about 8 hours on a machine with 8 cores).
- The directory *Base_Results* stores the output for base forecasts as .rds files.  These are very large so are not stored on github.
